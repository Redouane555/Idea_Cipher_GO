# Idea_Cipher_GO
a Golang implementation of the Idea block cipher (translated from DCPCrypt's implementation of Idea) that can be used with the crypto/cipher package to achieve encryption and decryption in different modes of operation (CBC, CTR, OFB, CFB etc.)


# Why

Because there isn't a publicly avaliable Golang implementation of Idea (or at least I couldn't find one)
